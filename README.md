VideoPlayer for the React Native `<Video>` component at [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video).

[![demogif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55203625/159137837-4e34a8be-1cbb-48ae-9d67-99ce4922e660.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55203625/159138065-cf3554b6-3f8b-4cab-bf94-0f3fc0b57333.gif)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

This package contains a simple set of GUI controls that work with the [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) `<Video>` component. 
- [x] Back Button
- [x] Volume bar
- [x] Fullscreen button
- [x] Play/Pause button
- [x] Rewind/Forward buttons
- [x] Seekbar
- [x] Title
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Timer 
- [ ] Rate button

By default the `<VideoPlayer>` accepts a navigator property from React's built-in `<Navigator>` which pops the current scene off the stack when tapped. Alternatively you can provide your own onBack prop to the component to override this functionality. You should also provide your own onEnd prop to the component so it knows what to do when a video ends playback.

By default, tapping the screen anywhere will show the player controls. After 15s the controls disappear. Double tapping will toggle fullscreen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Run `yarn add react-native-video react-native-media-console`

Then follow installation instructions
from [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video).

We're actively supporting only RN < 45.

## üõ† Usage

The `<VideoPlayer>` component follows the API of the `<Video>` component
at [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video). It also takes a number of
additional props which are outlined in the [API](#-api) section.

For basic operation the `<VideoPlayer>` component requires a video source and a navigator property. The default back
button functionality in the component relies on using the built-in `<Navigator>` functionality in React Native and pops
the current scene off the stack. This can be overridden if desired, see the [API](#-api) for more details.

```javascript
// At the top where our imports are...
import VideoPlayer from 'react-native-media-console';

// in the component's render() function
<VideoPlayer
  source={{uri: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4'}}
  navigator={props.navigator}
/>;
```

To play a local file, use require syntax like so:

```js
<VideoPlayer source={require('path/to/file')} />
```

## üß∞ API

The `<VideoPlayer>` component can take a number of inputs to customize it as needed. They are outlined below:

### Props

You can pass any of the props that the `<Video />` component at [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) takes. Simply add them onto the `<VideoPlayer />` and it will pass them through to the `<Video />` component.

In addition, the `<VideoPlayer />` also takes these props:

| Prop                         | Type         | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| doubleTapTime                | Integer      | 130        | Tapping twice within this amount of time in milliseconds is considered a double tap. Single taps will not be actioned until this time has expired.              |
